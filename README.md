# The Tidy Data Course Project
### Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## The target of the Course Project is to 
1. make the R script which makes `tidy_data.txt` file from the `source data`
2. make the set of the files with the descriptions of the work done
3. upload project to the GitHub


## Files in the project:
- README.md (this file)
- run_analysis.R - file with the R code which makes tidy_data.txt from the `source data`
- tidy_data.txt - the file with the results of the runnig run_analysis.R :) (sorry for the loop)
- CodeBook.md - description of the Items in the tidy_data.txt file

## Source Data

Full description of the Sorce Data could be found under the following [link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## What the `run_analysis.R` doing:
1. Downloads the Source data and unzip it
2. Loads the `source data` values and related dictionaries
3. Merge the data together, makes the user-friendly names
4. Evaluates Averages from the `source data`
5. Writes the `tidy_data.txt` result file
